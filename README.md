# Chat Bot Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the development and usage of a chat bot implemented in Python using the Gemini API within Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## Overview

The chat bot is designed to interact with users in natural language, responding to queries, providing information, and executing tasks based on predefined commands. It utilizes the Gemini API to access various functionalities such as retrieving market data, executing trades, and accessing account information on the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any other Python IDE
- Gemini API key and secret (sign up for an account on Gemini and generate API keys)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command in your terminal:

   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Configuration

Before running the chat bot, you need to configure your Gemini API key and secret in the config.py file. Open the config.py file and replace the placeholders with your actual API key and secret:

python
# config.py

API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
API_SECRET = 'YOUR_API_SECRET'


## Usage

To run the chat bot, execute the chatbot.py script using Python:


python chatbot.py


Once the chat bot is running, you can interact with it using natural language queries and commands. The bot will process your input, execute relevant actions using the Gemini API, and provide responses accordingly.

## Features

- *Market Data:* Retrieve real-time market data including current prices, trading volume, and market trends.
- *Trade Execution:* Execute buy or sell orders for cryptocurrencies based on user input.
- *Account Information:* Access account balances, transaction history, and other account-related information.
- *Natural Language Processing:* Utilize natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries effectively.

## Example Usage

1. *Get Current Price:*

   
   User: What is the current price of Bitcoin?
   Chat Bot: The current price of Bitcoin is $XX,XXX.
   

2. *Place Buy Order:*

   
   User: Buy 0.5 BTC at market price.
   Chat Bot: Order successfully placed: Bought 0.5 BTC at market price.
   

3. *Retrieve Account Balance:*

   
   User: What is my account balance?
   Chat Bot: Your account balance is: BTC XX, ETH XX, USD XX.
